Dearest guests,

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made the difficult decision to postpone our wedding. The health of all our loved ones is very important to us and we will wait until it is safe for everyone to attend without any worries.

We are still planning to have our wedding when it's completely safe to travel, and we will let you know once we have decided a new date. We hope everyone is ready to wait, and we are all looking forward to celebrating with everyone.

If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Until then, please stay safe and know weâ€™re thinking of you all!
